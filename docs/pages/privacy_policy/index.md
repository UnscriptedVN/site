# Privacy Policy

The following page should explain what kind of information this game collects and how that information is used.

## What Unscripted collects

### For Unscripted stickers on iMessage and Telegram

The Unscripted sticker pack on iMessage, Telegram, etc. does **not** collect any information that gets transmitted to a remote server and analyzed. The sticker pack does not include any extra packages.

### For Unscripted and Unscripted Core

Unscripted, the core game, does not collect any information that gets transmitted to a remote server and analyzed. The information asked in the beginning of the game such as a username and the type of app you want to develop is not collected in any way and is stored on your device in your save files.

Unscripted does include additional packages, namely `discord-rpc`, that enables users to connect their game to Discord for Rich Presence. This may collect data; the user can turn off Rich Presence at any time in the Settings under "Extras".

The "Report a Bug" feature on the main menu does open the web browser to open GitHub. GitHub may collect data in your browser and users are subject to GitHub's privacy policy, but this does not communicate with Unscripted.

## Why this page is here

Apps on the Mac App Store and the like are required to link back to a privacy policy, so this page has been written to comply with this request.
