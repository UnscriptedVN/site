Howdy!

Thanks to all of those who got their hands on the demo! I've just released a quick patch update that fixes a couple of issues:

- Emails should now work properly in-game (fixes [UVN-32](https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-32))
- USB drives should now not take over your inventory and multiply when you roll back (fixes [UVN-33](https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-33))

If you find any more issues, please do let me know on YouTrack! Thanks again.
