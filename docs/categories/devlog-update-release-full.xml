&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasure and honor to tell you all that, after a year and a half of development, Unscripted has finally launched! ðŸŽ‰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what I was exactly getting into when I first started making Unscripted. Initially, I had many plans for the plot, but I didn't necessarily plan out everything else for an indie game. Fast-forward to today, and I've done a lot for the game. With the choices and routes for this game, the minigame levels, and collaboration with artists like Raseruuu and music composer Marek DomagaÅ‚a, Unscripted is far beyond what I imagined doing my summer job.&lt;/p&gt;
