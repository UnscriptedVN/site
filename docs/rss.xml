&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasure and honor to tell you all that, after a year and a half of development, Unscripted has finally launched! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what I was exactly getting into when I first started making Unscripted. Initially, I had many plans for the plot, but I didn't necessarily plan out everything else for an indie game. Fast-forward to today, and I've done a lot for the game. With the choices and routes for this game, the minigame levels, and collaboration with artists like Raseruuu and music composer Marek Domagała, Unscripted is far beyond what I imagined doing my summer job.&lt;/p&gt;

# Captain's Devlog: September-October 2020

#writing #devlog #unscripted
 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time sure flies when you're having fun... or stuck in the middle of a pandemic. With that said, it's time for me to make an update on what's been happening with Unscripted in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fixing bugs (of bugs, of bugs, of bugs)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides minor quality-of-life improvements, the past developer beta cycles have focused on doing lots of bug fixes. While Unscripted does include lots of interesting things, it suffers from bug creep, and the next few betas to insiders have tried to squash a lot of them. The latest betas have been focusing on the minigame's bugs, and I'm pleased to say that the minigame is a lot more polished now than in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing, One-Two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in May, I launched the Unscripted Playtesting Program as a means of getting feedback for Unscripted. Since then, I've received lots of reports that have helped make the game better now than when I launched the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had launched the Steam page for Unscripted, which was something I was hesitant about at first. Thanks to feedback and internal discussion, I pushed through. After publishing the page, I started testing Unscripted through Steam to see if there were any hiccups. I'm pleased to say that, as of right now, no reports have arose due to an issue with Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam aside, I recently moved the playtesting program to its own separate page, &lt;a href="https://beta.unscriptedvn.dev"&gt;https://beta.unscriptedvn.dev&lt;/a&gt;. This portal aims to help centralize a lot of developer-related things such as beta release notes, reports, and update announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of 2020 is coming a lot closer than anyone's probably anticipated. With this in mind, I feel confident that the major features of Unscripted have been solidified. I hope to accomplish the following things before working on finalizing the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, a slight update to the minigame where players can use pre-made NadiaVM scripts in the interactive mode to speed up the game a bit. I'm undecided on how this will work, but I'm confident I'll think of something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, focus on completing the story. Most of the chapters have been written, but I'd like to get the last couple of chapters done to wrap up the game and tell the story I want to tell. Now that features should be done, I can spend the rest of the time to finalize the story.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, I aim to fix any continuity issues, bland parts, and in-cohesive parts of the story so that it flows better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If time allows, I'll try to add more choices to get specific dialogue points, though it isn't guaranteed at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, I will focus on gathering the rest of the assets needed for the game, including CGs and music. The story and game itself is fine at the moment, but it doesn't feel unique or as polished yet. I think adding new music and CG assets can greatly improve in this department.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I will do my best to squash any remaining bugs. I'd like to get Unscripted to be as bug-free as it can be while still maintaining the "developer" image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot going on for the remainder of Unscripted's development, and I can't wait to share a final product with you all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/unscripted-2?utm_source=badge-featured&amp;amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;amp;utm_souce=badge-unscripted-2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=270928&amp;amp;theme=light" alt="Unscripted - A visual novel about software development | Product Hunt" style="width: 250px; height: 54px;" width="250" height="54"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>beta</category><category>devlog</category><category>steam</category><category>testing</category><guid>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/10/18/captains-devlog-september-october-2020/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 02:10:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Captain's Devlog: July-August 2020</title><link>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/08/22/captains-devlog-july-august-2020/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, folks! It's about that time again where I give some insight on what's been going on with Unscripted. Get comfortable; I got a lot to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A brand new identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTcwMDcucG5n/original/zkmTli.png" alt="Itch.io header"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in May/June, I started working on bringing a new, adaptable look to Unscripted, built off of the Ayu color scheme. This feature is ready to go in the game and the look has also been adopted on the official website. The Itch.io page also saw an interface update to better match the colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late June, Apple unveiled a new look for macOS Big Sur during their WWDC event. I wanted to make Unscripted feel at home on the new update while giving it the signature identity it's had since inception. So, with the new macOS Big Sur icons, I've given the Unscripted brand more subtlety. Gone are the random bubble artworks from before; in their place, we're using gradients with Unscripted's signature brand colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A better minigame has landed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/preview3.png" alt="New minigame look"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since June, I've been working on giving the minigame in Unscripted a major overhaul. As it exists in the demo, it felt more of a tacked-on gimmick with no potential meaning whatsoever. In my previous devlog, I stated that I wanted to change that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that, within the next month or so, I will have a fully working rewrite of the minigame with more appealing visuals, a coherent plot, and a new input mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've made several improvements to the minigame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, the visuals. Gone is the tacky minigame look with some mastodon and coins. Now, the tileset consists of pixel art walls, floors, desks, etc. The main character is no longer a mastodon but Mia, an employee at a tech startup company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, there are several improvements to the Fira API and NadiaVM language. New features like interactive modes, comment support, and a more direct way of controlling the player via the API exist in the library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, there's a brand-new basic mode that utilizes the interactive mode in NadiaVM to send commands and play levels in real time, without complilation. I think this is a more fun way of playing the minigame than attempting to push buttons and guess the correct order to push them in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides the API and interactive improvements, the minigame now includes little "glitches" that also act as game mechanics. These bugs are to be exploited by the player to solve the puzzle, giving the game an interesting approach to solving puzzles. Sadly, we couldn't fit any portals in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the minigame will be better integrated into the game's plot by becoming the game that you, the player, are publishing to the PackStore Arcade! Parts of the story have been rewritten to accomodate for this change, and I hope to add more levels and content to the minigame that make it feel integrated, yet stand out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm super excited for this updated minigame. It's arguably a lot more fun to play around with (and more fun to work on), and I can't wait for you all to get your hands on it when the final game releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The core is open (and other cool developer stuff)!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may recall in my previous devlog about my plans to take some parts of Unscripted and make then open source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make Unscripted a place to go to learn new things and try out what's available with Python and Ren'Py just like how I did when making mods for DDLC, so I've decided that I will be open-sourcing some core utilities and modules inside of the game itself known as the Unscripted Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some more playtesting builds, I've made the source code publicly available. Although the code is still a work in progress, it's available for tinkering on GitHub under the Mozilla Public License, v2.0 at &lt;a href="https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/core"&gt;https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/core&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other open-source news, I recently created a new Python library for Unscripted's changelog format. This library is used in-game to read the changelog and display the latest features when you launch the game after an update. Known as Simple Changes (&lt;code&gt;simplechanges&lt;/code&gt;), this library is available in PyPI and the source code is also available on GitHub. Additionally, I recently published a Visual Studio Code extension, the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marquiskurt.uvn-lang-pack"&gt;Unscripted Language Pack&lt;/a&gt;, that adds NadiaVM and SimpleChanges (.changes) as languages and provides basic syntax highlighting. If you're using Simple Changes and/or want to edit the minigame's NadiaVM files in style, this is the extension for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/posts/docs-center.png" alt="Documentation Center Homepage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'm pleased to say that there's a unified place for the documentation of all Unscripted open-source projects: the documentation center! The Documentation Center is available at &lt;a href="https://docs.unscriptedvn.dev"&gt;https://docs.unscriptedvn.dev&lt;/a&gt; and covers all of the docs for Fira, Unscripted Core, Simple Changes, and the Ren'Py Distribution Tools I launched back in December. This should make searching for documentation much easier and a pleasure to use. I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Oh, the places we can go!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the inception of this project, Unscripted has been available on Itch.io in demo form. Itch.io has been a wonderful place and storefront to host Unscripted on. Many people have downloaded and seen Unscripted from this place, and adding updates has been a smooth process. Recently, I took a look at a bunch of feedback from the playesting program and, after some careful consideration, launched the official Steam page for Unscripted! I worked with an amazing team to help assemble the trailer together, and I spent a good amount of time learning how to upload builds to Steam. After waiting for a review from Valve, the page finally launched in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the page and add Unscripted to your wishlist here: &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1379980/Unscripted/"&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1379980/Unscripted/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm super excited to bring Unscripted to Steam, and I hope you are as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just about covers the major points for the past two months. I can't wait to share what's in store soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>beta</category><category>devlog</category><category>steam</category><category>testing</category><guid>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/08/22/captains-devlog-july-august-2020/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 18:29:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Captain's Devlog: May-June 2020</title><link>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/06/15/captains-devlog-may-june-2020/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been about a couple of months since I wrote the last devlog that outline what's been going on, and I figured it's time for me to do the same thing again since I haven't posted much on the official site. Here's a rundown of what's been happing the past few weeks with Unscripted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extended demo updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I published the v1.2.4 release of the extended demo, which contained a couple of bugfixes and improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolves an issue where the AliceOS desktop could be called infinitely on the call stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds argument options via arguments.toml.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds a glossary page in Help with terms and definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds use cases for inventory items in some parts of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes notification toast when an item is received to the game’s default, not AliceOS’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes documented features in Help that don’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that, unless there are major flaws in the current release of the extended demo, there won't be any future updates as development builds will most likely break compatibility with older releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hello, Ayu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks, I've been working on making Unscripted's user interface and brand consistent. Part of this included reconsidering the color scheme and general user interface look. After some deliberation, I've worked on implementing a variation of the popular &lt;a href="https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors"&gt;Ayu color scheme&lt;/a&gt; as the theme for Unscripted. Ayu offers vibrant colors and a great set of colors to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/posts/ayu-scrn.png" class="ms-shadowed"&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:2px"&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;In-game screenshot of Ayu Light theme.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/posts/ayu-prefs.png" class="ms-shadowed"&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top:2px"&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;Appearance page in Ayu Dark theme.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ayu offers light, blue, and dark variations of the color scheme, I've implemented a new theme system for the game and include all three variations. The official website also got a bit of a makeover to include the new colors, as well as the Itch.io page. I've also implemented some quality-of-life additions to the game to customize its appearance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now select which font you want to use for dialogue as well as its size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Merriweather and OpenDyslexic fonts have been added as font options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lexend fonts are now a sub-page to Appearance (&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; › &lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt; › &lt;strong&gt;Dialogue font&lt;/strong&gt; › &lt;strong&gt;Lexend...&lt;/strong&gt;) instead of a slider. This should hopefully resolve some font selection issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calling all playtesters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/playtest.png" alt="Playtesting Program promo image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the past months, I've also been on the hunt for playtesters to get feedback of the game as it's being developed. I've consulted people on Twitter, Reddit, and Discord as I continue to work on the game. I've gotten feedback from a few people and have made improvements to the game as I receive more suggestions. Previously, I had been only accepting members on a limited basis since I was still working out the kinks in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that everything's all organized and ready to go, I've decided to open the game up to more playtesters on a semi-public beta program known as the &lt;strong&gt;Unscripted Playtesting Program&lt;/strong&gt;. The playtesting program is a great way to get involved and give feedback on the project as I develop it. The new &lt;a href="https://unscriptedvn.dev/pages/playtests/"&gt;playtesting program page&lt;/a&gt; outlines the process, requirements, and what happens in the beta program. I welcome and encourage players to try out the latest development builds and help make Unscripted reach its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unscripted ♥️ open-source and GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in late 2019/early 2020, I released the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/renpy-distribute-tools"&gt;Ren'Py Distribution Tools&lt;/a&gt; module (&lt;code&gt;renpy-distribute-tools&lt;/code&gt;) as an open-source module on GitHub to help streamline distribution of visual novel projects. This module has made its way to PyPI and migrated over to a new place on GitHub for all Unscripted-related code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/posts/gh.png" alt="GitHub organization page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, there have been a couple of other repositories open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/mastina"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mastina&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Nikola theme for the Unscripted website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/fira"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fira&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the backend and API mechanisms for the current minigame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also recall in an earlier post that a &lt;a href="https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/issues"&gt;new GitHub repository is available&lt;/a&gt; to report bugs and request features for the game, which replaced YouTrack. GitHub is also where a lot of work on Unscripted takes place, ranging from the minigame to the core story. With the new playtesting program in place, this also is where a lot of developer builds for testing take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, open-source software is what makes Unscripted possible; libraries such as &lt;code&gt;discord-rpc&lt;/code&gt; and projects like Ren'Py, Inter, and Feather icons have helped bring Unscripted together to the game it is today. I make it a point to thank the open-source community by acknowledging them in both the credits and the game's license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why bring up open-source software and GitHub? I personally am a believer in open-source software; open-source software has helped me grow as a developer and has taught me a lot of valuable things. Open-source modding projects for DDLC have also taught me a lot of what I know with both Python and Ren'Py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I anticipate that some players and developers may want to better understand how I do some things in Unscripted or may want to contribute to the project to catch any bugs. I want to make Unscripted a place to go to learn new things and try out what's available with Python and Ren'Py just like how I did when making mods for DDLC, so I've decided that I will be open-sourcing some core utilities and modules inside of the game itself known as the Unscripted Core. In fact, I made this decision all the way back in &lt;em&gt;January&lt;/em&gt;; some of the demo builds use this new open-source code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is mostly set up to handle open-sourcing Unscripted Core. In the final release of the game, the source code for Unscripted Core will be available right in the game as a standard Ren'Py archive. You can also expect to see the GitHub repository available in the following weeks, licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0, the same license used in Unscripted Fira, Mastina, and the Ren'Py Distribution Tools. I can't wait to reveal what's been under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An overhaul of the minigame... again...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/posts/mg.png" alt="Minigame"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I released the extended demo, I introduced a brand new minigame where players control a mastodon with a series of commands, either by clicking buttons or using Python, to collect a bunch of coins and reach the end of the map. After receiving some feedback from playtesters, I realize that the minigame isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that, within the next month or so, I will have a fully working rewrite of the minigame with more appealing visuals, a coherent plot, and a new input mechanic. In the coming weeks, I also intend to rework the story a bit to turn the minigame into the game that the main character will eventually publish to the PackStore. I will post details on the progress I've made on the minigame as they get developed; I've got some exciting ideas that will be interesting to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this was a long devlog, but I thank you for reading all the way through. I look forward to sharing more information on Unscripted's progress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've pushed out an update with tons of quality of life improvements and bug fixes. If you find anything out of the ordinary or encounter a new bug, let me know! You can join the Discord server and tell me there, or use the issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the issue tracker, there's been a big change regarding bug reports. Since I started coding Unscripted, I used the YouTrack issue tracker to manage issues related to the game, and it's served me well thus far. However, there are some limitations with YouTrack currently, and it's not the best experience for play testers or regular players; it's still heavily developer-oriented and may be daunting. After working with my team and a handful of play testers, I'm pleased to announce that we're going all in with GitHub!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with this release, if you want to file a bug report or make a feature request, create an issue on GitHub at &lt;a href="https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/issues/issues/"&gt;https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/issues/issues/&lt;/a&gt;. You can also click the message icon in the game menu or press Shift+B while in-game to open GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the full changelog for those who are interested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolves an issue where minigame levels with "collect" in Basic Mode fail due to incorrect VM code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes a couple of minor typos, including pronoun conjugation agreement issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolves an issue where attempting to view the license on a read-only file system fails (IOError).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds more details about the different game modes and a preview image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds new "Warp Speed" option to minigame preview animation speeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds options to show hidden NadiaVM commands and reduce spacing in VM preview window in Basic Mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds an option to forcefully show the editor in Advanced Mode when an existing VM file is present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves minigame experience by rolling back to last checkpoint if an error occurs during the minigame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevents minigame overriding between modes by namespacing NadiaVM based on game mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds keybinding 'l' to open the Unscripted log file (or select it in the file browser).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes AliceOS Desktop keybind ('d') universally available, not just the game menu or in the quick menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates Fira API, which includes fixes for reporting proper list coordinates when calling "as_list".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases the font contrast on muted text colors in the game menu.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Adds option to display the chapter number and chapter title when switching to a new chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes some hiding animations of characters to the side instead of the standard hide.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Improved new credits screen with condensed spacing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds keybinding 'Shift+B' to open the bug reporter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaces "Back", "Hub", "Report a Bug", and "Quit" with icon buttons in game menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moves back button in the game menu to far left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moves bug reporter button in the game menu to far right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes alignment of the game menu buttons on the right side.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Marquis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>update</category><guid>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/04/25/v120-extended-demo-is-here/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 17:05:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Captain's Devlog: March-April 2020</title><link>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/04/02/devlog-march-april-2020/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since my last update to the demo was released (about a month or two, I believe), and I haven't released much since then. However, there are a couple of things I'd like to tell you all about what's been going on with Unscripted the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A new character steps forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After publishing the demo, I went to work into writing more of the full story with multiple routes. Unfortunately, I was kind of a bit struck with writer's block and needed to find a solution before starting to lose interest. Luckily, I figured out a solution that I think this visual novel deserves: a new, fourth character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/posts/fira1.png" alt="Meredith 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of a week ago, I teamed up with Raseruuu, the game's sprite artist, to bring her to life into the game. This new character, "Meredith" (legal name), is the first non-programmer in the game and has a unique personality that I think you'll all love learning more about as much I have been writing for her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's Rush Drawing time!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;new sprite for Unscripted VN&lt;br&gt;I need that commission money uguu, salary hasn't come uwaaa&lt;a href="https://t.co/eMFqIvvuxC"&gt;https://t.co/eMFqIvvuxC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/b465RRWMtZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b465RRWMtZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zan Kizuna @SoftWar (@Raseruuuuu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Raseruuuuu/status/1242428269963567111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expanding the minigame&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that I wanted to add more to the minigame that Unscripted offers. For those that may not be familiar, Unscripted includes a minigame in which you control Mastina, a mastodon, through a world, collecting coins in the process. The minigame currently uses a set of buttons that a player clicks in a specific order to solve the puzzle, but I know that I personally would prefer to have the flexibility of writing a script rather than entering one in manually with a user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscriptedvn.dev/assets/img/posts/api.png" alt="API"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the Unscripted Minigame API. The Minigame API is part of a bigger chunk of the minigame's advanced mode where players can write Python scripts to solve the puzzle instead of using the buttons. This should give experienced (and new) players/developers the flexibility that Python offers while allowing players to write sensible code and interact with the minigame that wouldn't be possible otherwise. I've also been working on writing some solid documentation that explains the API in great detail and everything you need to know to write great scripts to solve puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So... extended demo?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a really &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZRpoA1PLKF?amp=1"&gt;fun playthrough of Unscripted's demo that I've watched&lt;/a&gt;, and the YouTuber, Cryptic Hybrid, brought up the question of possibly releasing an extended demo. After some thinking and working on the new character and advanced mode of the minigame, I will probably release an extended demo. The demo will come as a traditional feature update to the game, and it will probably include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More chapters available to where all characters have been introduced. This will let players meet each character, especially the new addition to the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some minigame puzzles, with the advanced mode ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New iconography for the app on Windows and macOS that best represent the platforms they're running on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new start screen for a new game that lets you choose your programming language and pronoun preferences in addition to your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Possibly) Some scenes with CGs. Because they're always fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to keep up with the dev-logging and let you know more about Unscripted as I keep developing it. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Marquis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>devlog</category><guid>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/04/02/devlog-march-april-2020/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 01:15:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Releasing a hotfix for v1.1.0-demo1</title><link>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/01/31/releasing-a-hotfix-for-v110-demo1/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy, folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm releasing a quick (but important) hotfix of the feature update for the Unscripted Demo feature update (v1.1.0-demo1). There's not much to this update, but it should resolve the missing start label issue found on Windows (see &lt;a href="https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-43"&gt;UVN-43&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, it brings a new version of the demo license that better explains the terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature and improvement-wise, there aren't a lot of changes to the game in this update that affect the gameplay. However, this is the first version of Unscripted Demo that uses the new build system that the current developer project uses, so the Ren'Py archives are slightly different and some things might function a little bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your continued patience, and I can't wait to get the full game out later this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've released a new feature update for the Unscripted demo (v1.1.0-demo1) that brings some new improvements. Here's what's in the update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambient sounds&lt;/strong&gt;: Unscripted now has ambient sounds! You can adjust the ambient volume in Settings and listen to appropriate background sounds while playing. This will also automatically adjust with "Emphasize sound effects" turned on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina updates&lt;/strong&gt;: Christina's eye color has been updated to a hazel color instead of just brown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QuickMail&lt;/strong&gt;: The first email you receive has been re-written to better reflect Christina's personality. She's not the pushy type...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desktop image&lt;/strong&gt;: The desktop image has been updated to wave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save/load slots&lt;/strong&gt;: The UI for save and load slots has been improved and now has a respective delete button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those wondering about the inventory state issue, that has been patched into the full game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing Unscripted, and I hope you enjoy these new improvements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Marquis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>demo</category><category>feature</category><category>update</category><guid>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/01/27/first-feature-update-for-unscripted-demo/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:42:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Releasing the distribution tools</title><link>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/01/04/releasing-the-distribution-tools/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm releasing the tools that I have written to make Ren'Py distribution for the Mac a bit easier. This package, &lt;code&gt;renpy-distribute-tools&lt;/code&gt;, is an open-source module for Python 3 and is Poetry-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why not &lt;code&gt;renpy/mac-notarization&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started developing the tools before the scripts published on the Ren'Py GitHub were uploaded. Initially, the tools were bundled in the same place where I develop Unscripted, but I've moved them elsewhere when modernizing the Unscripted project. These tools also are just a bunch of Python functions and classes, so you can integrate them more easily into your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to get it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the tools at &lt;a href="https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/renpy-distribute-tools"&gt;https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/renpy-distribute-tools&lt;/a&gt; via GitHub. You can either download the latest release, clone the source code manually, or add them as a dependency to your Poetry project if you're using &lt;a href="https://python-poetry.org"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt; to manage your VN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-toml"&gt;[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
renpy-distribute-tools = { git = "https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/renpy-distribute-tools.git", rev = "v0.2.2" }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to use it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools don't come with any pre-built scripts like the Mac notarization tools provided by Ren'Py, but you can call the methods in the module to simplify the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to fix the property list for the Mac build, code sign, and notarize it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;from renpy_distribute_tools import fix_plist, code_sign, upload_to_notary

author = "Joe Smith"
bundle_identifier = "com.example.my-vn"
code_sign_identity = "Developer ID Application: Joe Smith (XXXXXXXXXX)"
app_path = "VN-1.0.0-dists/VN-1.0.0-mac/VN.app"
apple_email = "example.joesmith@icloud.com"
apple_provider = "XXXXXXXXXX"

fix_plist(app_path + "/Contents/Info.plist",
          bundle_identifier,
          "© %s %s. All rights reserved." % (date.today().year, author))
code_sign(code_sign_identity,
          app_path,
          entitlements="../../entitlements.plist",
          enable_hardened_runtime=True)
try:
    upload_to_notary(app_path,
                     bundle_identifier,
                     apple_email,
                     "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD",
                     provider=apple_provider)
except CalledProcessError:
    print("\033[31;1mNotarization request failed. Aborting.\033[0m")
    sys.exit(1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also some documentation that you can read at &lt;a href="https://marquiskurt.net/renpy-distribute-tools/"&gt;https://marquiskurt.net/renpy-distribute-tools/&lt;/a&gt; to know what functions are available for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>distribute</category><category>tools</category><guid>https://unscriptedvn.dev/posts/2020/01/04/releasing-the-distribution-tools/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 18:31:07 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
