&lt;p&gt;The big extended demo update you've all be waiting for is finally here! You'll notice that the "demo" moniker in the version name has been dropped, but don't panic; it's still a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzMzMjcyNDIucG5n/original/KZOQ3C.png" alt="Minigame view"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Marquis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>update</category><guid>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/04/25/v120-extended-demo-is-here/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 17:05:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Captain's Devlog: March-April 2020</title><link>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/04/02/devlog-march-april-2020/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since my last update to the demo was released (about a month or two, I believe), and I haven't released much since then. However, there are a couple of things I'd like to tell you all about what's been going on with Unscripted the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A new character steps forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After publishing the demo, I went to work into writing more of the full story with multiple routes. Unfortunately, I was kind of a bit struck with writer's block and needed to find a solution before starting to lose interest. Luckily, I figured out a solution that I think this visual novel deserves: a new, fourth character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/assets/img/posts/fira1.png" alt="Meredith 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of a week ago, I teamed up with Raseruuu, the game's sprite artist, to bring her to life into the game. This new character, "Meredith" (legal name), is the first non-programmer in the game and has a unique personality that I think you'll all love learning more about as much I have been writing for her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's Rush Drawing time!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;new sprite for Unscripted VN&lt;br&gt;I need that commission money uguu, salary hasn't come uwaaa&lt;a href="https://t.co/eMFqIvvuxC"&gt;https://t.co/eMFqIvvuxC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/b465RRWMtZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b465RRWMtZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zan Kizuna @SoftWar (@Raseruuuuu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Raseruuuuu/status/1242428269963567111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expanding the minigame&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that I wanted to add more to the minigame that Unscripted offers. For those that may not be familiar, Unscripted includes a minigame in which you control Mastina, a mastodon, through a world, collecting coins in the process. The minigame currently uses a set of buttons that a player clicks in a specific order to solve the puzzle, but I know that I personally would prefer to have the flexibility of writing a script rather than entering one in manually with a user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/assets/img/posts/api.png" alt="API"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the Unscripted Minigame API. The Minigame API is part of a bigger chunk of the minigame's advanced mode where players can write Python scripts to solve the puzzle instead of using the buttons. This should give experienced (and new) players/developers the flexibility that Python offers while allowing players to write sensible code and interact with the minigame that wouldn't be possible otherwise. I've also been working on writing some solid documentation that explains the API in great detail and everything you need to know to write great scripts to solve puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So... extended demo?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a really &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZRpoA1PLKF?amp=1"&gt;fun playthrough of Unscripted's demo that I've watched&lt;/a&gt;, and the YouTuber, Cryptic Hybrid, brought up the question of possibly releasing an extended demo. After some thinking and working on the new character and advanced mode of the minigame, I will probably release an extended demo. The demo will come as a traditional feature update to the game, and it will probably include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More chapters available to where all characters have been introduced. This will let players meet each character, especially the new addition to the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some minigame puzzles, with the advanced mode ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New iconography for the app on Windows and macOS that best represent the platforms they're running on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new start screen for a new game that lets you choose your programming language and pronoun preferences in addition to your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Possibly) Some scenes with CGs. Because they're always fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to keep up with the dev-logging and let you know more about Unscripted as I keep developing it. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Marquis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>devlog</category><guid>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/04/02/devlog-march-april-2020/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 01:15:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Releasing a hotfix for v1.1.0-demo1</title><link>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/01/31/releasing-a-hotfix-for-v110-demo1/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy, folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm releasing a quick (but important) hotfix of the feature update for the Unscripted Demo feature update (v1.1.0-demo1). There's not much to this update, but it should resolve the missing start label issue found on Windows (see &lt;a href="https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-43"&gt;UVN-43&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, it brings a new version of the demo license that better explains the terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature and improvement-wise, there aren't a lot of changes to the game in this update that affect the gameplay. However, this is the first version of Unscripted Demo that uses the new build system that the current developer project uses, so the Ren'Py archives are slightly different and some things might function a little bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your continued patience, and I can't wait to get the full game out later this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Marquis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>demo</category><category>update</category><guid>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/01/31/releasing-a-hotfix-for-v110-demo1/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 21:24:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>First feature update for Unscripted Demo</title><link>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/01/27/first-feature-update-for-unscripted-demo/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've released a new feature update for the Unscripted demo (v1.1.0-demo1) that brings some new improvements. Here's what's in the update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambient sounds&lt;/strong&gt;: Unscripted now has ambient sounds! You can adjust the ambient volume in Settings and listen to appropriate background sounds while playing. This will also automatically adjust with "Emphasize sound effects" turned on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina updates&lt;/strong&gt;: Christina's eye color has been updated to a hazel color instead of just brown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QuickMail&lt;/strong&gt;: The first email you receive has been re-written to better reflect Christina's personality. She's not the pushy type...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desktop image&lt;/strong&gt;: The desktop image has been updated to wave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save/load slots&lt;/strong&gt;: The UI for save and load slots has been improved and now has a respective delete button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those wondering about the inventory state issue, that has been patched into the full game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing Unscripted, and I hope you enjoy these new improvements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Marquis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>demo</category><category>feature</category><category>update</category><guid>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/01/27/first-feature-update-for-unscripted-demo/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:42:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Releasing the distribution tools</title><link>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/01/04/releasing-the-distribution-tools/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm releasing the tools that I have written to make Ren'Py distribution for the Mac a bit easier. This package, &lt;code&gt;renpy-distribute-tools&lt;/code&gt;, is an open-source module for Python 3 and is Poetry-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why not &lt;code&gt;renpy/mac-notarization&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started developing the tools before the scripts published on the Ren'Py GitHub were uploaded. Initially, the tools were bundled in the same place where I develop Unscripted, but I've moved them elsewhere when modernizing the Unscripted project. These tools also are just a bunch of Python functions and classes, so you can integrate them more easily into your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to get it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the tools at &lt;a href="https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/renpy-distribute-tools"&gt;https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/renpy-distribute-tools&lt;/a&gt; via GitHub. You can either download the latest release, clone the source code manually, or add them as a dependency to your Poetry project if you're using &lt;a href="https://python-poetry.org"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt; to manage your VN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-toml"&gt;[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
renpy-distribute-tools = { git = "https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/renpy-distribute-tools.git", rev = "v0.2.2" }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to use it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools don't come with any pre-built scripts like the Mac notarization tools provided by Ren'Py, but you can call the methods in the module to simplify the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to fix the property list for the Mac build, code sign, and notarize it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;from renpy_distribute_tools import fix_plist, code_sign, upload_to_notary

author = "Joe Smith"
bundle_identifier = "com.example.my-vn"
code_sign_identity = "Developer ID Application: Joe Smith (XXXXXXXXXX)"
app_path = "VN-1.0.0-dists/VN-1.0.0-mac/VN.app"
apple_email = "example.joesmith@icloud.com"
apple_provider = "XXXXXXXXXX"

fix_plist(app_path + "/Contents/Info.plist",
          bundle_identifier,
          "© %s %s. All rights reserved." % (date.today().year, author))
code_sign(code_sign_identity,
          app_path,
          entitlements="../../entitlements.plist",
          enable_hardened_runtime=True)
try:
    upload_to_notary(app_path,
                     bundle_identifier,
                     apple_email,
                     "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD",
                     provider=apple_provider)
except CalledProcessError:
    print("\033[31;1mNotarization request failed. Aborting.\033[0m")
    sys.exit(1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also some documentation that you can read at &lt;a href="https://marquiskurt.net/renpy-distribute-tools/"&gt;https://marquiskurt.net/renpy-distribute-tools/&lt;/a&gt; to know what functions are available for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>distribute</category><category>tools</category><guid>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2020/01/04/releasing-the-distribution-tools/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 18:31:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Second bugfix for Unscripted demo</title><link>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2019/12/26/second-bugfix-for-unscripted-demo/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've released another bug fix release of the demo to Unscripted today. This mostly is a continuation of fixing issues with inventory item duplications (&lt;a href="https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-33"&gt;UVN-33&lt;/a&gt;). The following should now be fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When starting a new game after saving a game, the inventory should now clear itself in the beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolling back and forth in a particular save will no longer re-run the item addition, causing duplicates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Inventory HUD is a lot cleaner now and doesn't open if you aren't carrying anything. (You can also toggle the E key to open and close it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this fixes all of the issues with the way inventories are implemented, but I'm on the lookout for anything else that crops up. As always, if you do find something fishy with the demo release, report it on YouTrack! You can do so from the main menu with the "Report a Bug" option or head to the website yourself: &lt;a href="https://1n.pm/AsuXE"&gt;https://1n.pm/AsuXE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and I hope you all keep enjoying Unscripted!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>demo</category><guid>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2019/12/26/second-bugfix-for-unscripted-demo/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 18:24:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A quick hot fix update for the demo</title><link>https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net/posts/2019/12/24/a-quick-hot-fix-update-for-the-demo/</link><dc:creator>Marquis Kurt</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all of those who got their hands on the demo! I've just released a quick patch update that fixes a couple of issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emails should now work properly in-game (fixes &lt;a href="https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-32"&gt;UVN-32&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB drives should now not take over your inventory and multiply when you roll back (fixes &lt;a href="https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-33"&gt;UVN-33&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
