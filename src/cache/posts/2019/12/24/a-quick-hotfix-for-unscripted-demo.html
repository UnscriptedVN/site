<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>Thanks to all of those who got their hands on the demo! I've just released a quick patch update that fixes a couple of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emails should now work properly in-game (fixes <a href="https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-32">UVN-32</a>)</li>
<li>USB drives should now not take over your inventory and multiply when you roll back (fixes <a href="https://youtrack.marquiskurt.net/youtrack/issue/UVN-33">UVN-33</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find any more issues, please do let me know on YouTrack! Thanks again.</p>
