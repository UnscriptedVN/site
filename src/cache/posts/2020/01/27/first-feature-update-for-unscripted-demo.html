<p>Howdy, everyone!</p>
<p>I've released a new feature update for the Unscripted demo (v1.1.0-demo1) that brings some new improvements. Here's what's in the update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambient sounds</strong>: Unscripted now has ambient sounds! You can adjust the ambient volume in Settings and listen to appropriate background sounds while playing. This will also automatically adjust with &quot;Emphasize sound effects&quot; turned on.</li>
<li><strong>Christina updates</strong>: Christina's eye color has been updated to a hazel color instead of just brown.</li>
<li><strong>QuickMail</strong>: The first email you receive has been re-written to better reflect Christina's personality. She's not the pushy type...</li>
<li><strong>Desktop image</strong>: The desktop image has been updated to wave.</li>
<li><strong>Save/load slots</strong>: The UI for save and load slots has been improved and now has a respective delete button.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those wondering about the inventory state issue, that has been patched into the full game.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing Unscripted, and I hope you enjoy these new improvements!</p>
<p>- Marquis</p>
