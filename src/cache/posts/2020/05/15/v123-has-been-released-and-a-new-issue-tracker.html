<p>Hey, everyone!</p>
<p>I've pushed out an update with tons of quality of life improvements and bug fixes. If you find anything out of the ordinary or encounter a new bug, let me know! You can join the Discord server and tell me there, or use the issue tracker.</p>
<p>Speaking of the issue tracker, there's been a big change regarding bug reports. Since I started coding Unscripted, I used the YouTrack issue tracker to manage issues related to the game, and it's served me well thus far. However, there are some limitations with YouTrack currently, and it's not the best experience for play testers or regular players; it's still heavily developer-oriented and may be daunting. After working with my team and a handful of play testers, I'm pleased to announce that we're going all in with GitHub!</p>
<p>Starting with this release, if you want to file a bug report or make a feature request, create an issue on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/issues/issues/">https://github.com/UnscriptedVN/issues/issues/</a>. You can also click the message icon in the game menu or press Shift+B while in-game to open GitHub.</p>
